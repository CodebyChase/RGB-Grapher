# RGB-Grapher
Enter in three expressions including "x" and/or "y", and see how they interact on a specified range as they are translated to R,G, and B values at each pixel coordinate. Just download the zip, and run the executable jar.

The three expressions are handled independently of each other. Each color is linearly scaled to integer values from 0 to 255 on the specified range, with 0 being the minimum value and 255 being the maximum value attained in the graph for that color. 

The expression parser handles parenthesis, +, -, *, /, ^, sin, cos, tan, ln, and more functions. Constant values are scaled to zero.
